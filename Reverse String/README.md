## Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters  `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
**Output:** ["o","l","l","e","h"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
**Output:** ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
-   `s[i]`  is a  [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Follow up:**  Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array  [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)  with  `O(1)`  extra memory.
